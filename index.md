# Dominick Taylor's Data Science Project Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to highlight applicable data science project, coding, and visulization skills.

### Project 1 - Weather Retrieval Program
 [Link to project repo](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Weather_Retrieval_program)

This program will allow user to retrieve weather information for any location by entering the zip code or city name. The information is retrieved from a weather API.
This was a coding project completed in my Intro to programming course. This project highlights Python coding skills

- User enter a zip code or name of a city
- Enter a valid country
- Program retrieves Weather information for that location

## Project 2 - Text and Word Counter

This program will process a .txt file: (Gettysburg.txt was used in this exampple) and calculate the total words, and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file to another file. This was a coding project completed in my Intro to programming course. Again, this program highlights Python coding skills. This type of task is also useful for NLP project activities. 

- This program creates a running dictionary of all the text within the input file
- It then breaks out the total number of words within the dictionary and a count the occurances of the word

## Project 3 - Data Preparation from Multiple Sources
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Data_preparation)

This project gather NFL football related data for multiple sources, performs data transformation/manipulation and loads the data into database tables. This project highlights my ability to gather data from multiple sources in different formats and manipulate/ prepare it for analysis.

- data was gathered via CSV, Web scraping, and API utlization
- data was manipulated, cleansed, and loaded into a database using SQLite


## Project 4 - Natural Language Processing Project
[Link to project repo](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Natural_Language_Process_Project)

For this project I gathered Twitter data from US senators and classified their related political party based on the context of their tweets. I was able to predict the affiliated political party with good accuracy utilizing Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier and Logistic Regression models. Below is a image of the Logistic Regression Classification Report.
