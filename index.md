# Dominick Taylor's Data Science Project Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to highlight applicable data science project, coding, and visulization skills.

### Project 1 - Weather Retrieval Program
 [Link to project repo](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Weather_Retrieval_program)

This program will allow user to retrieve weather information for any location by entering the zip code or city name. The information is retrieved from a weather API.
This was a coding project completed in my Intro to programming course. This project highlights Python coding skills

- User enter a zip code or name of a city
- Enter a valid country
- Program retrieves Weather information for that location

### Project 2 - Text and Word Counter
[Link to project repo](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Word_Counter)

This program will process a .txt file: (Gettysburg.txt was used in this exampple) and calculate the total words, and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file to another file. This was a coding project completed in my Intro to programming course. Again, this program highlights Python coding skills. This type of task is also useful for NLP project activities. 

- This program creates a running dictionary of all the text within the input file
- It then breaks out the total number of words within the dictionary and a count the occurances of the word

### Project 3 - Data Preparation from Multiple Sources
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Data_preparation)

This project gather NFL football related data for multiple sources, performs data transformation/manipulation and loads the data into database tables. This project highlights my ability to gather data from multiple sources in different formats and manipulate/ prepare it for analysis.

- data was gathered via CSV, Web scraping, and API utlization
- data was manipulated, cleansed, and loaded into a database using SQLite


### Project 4 - Natural Language Processing Project
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Natural_Language_Process_Project)

For this project I gathered Twitter data from US senators and classified their related political party based on the context of their tweets. I was able to predict the affiliated political party with good accuracy utilizing Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier and Logistic Regression models. Below is a image of the Logistic Regression Classification Report. Through this project I was able to grasp key concepts in the NLP process.

### Project 5 - Auto Insurance Fraud Detection
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Auto_Insurance_Fraud_Detection)

Here I utilized Auto Insurance claim data to train several machine learning models to detect fraudulent activity. Data collection, data preparation, exploration, and model development were all completed as a part of this project. This project helped me better understand different modeling concepts such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost

### Project 6 - Cancer Diagnosis Project
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Cancer_Diagnosis_Project)

This project exams tumor statistics and predicts if it is Cancerous or Non-Cancerous. It utilizes several machine learning models to accurately predict the target. Again, Data collection, data preparation, exploration, and model development were all completed as a part of this project. For a project like this accuracy is extremely important. I was able to achieve great results.



### Project 7 - Market Segmentation Project
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Market_Segmentation)

For this project a K-means clustering algorithm was used to segment customer data into distinct groups based on personal information, products they purchase, and how they purchase. This was my first clustering and unsupervised learning project. I was able to learn more about the process and able to get good results. Below is the Principal Component Analysis from my customer segmentation that visualizes the results. Also, I have provided a sample analysis of customer income by cluster. This graph was developed using Seaborn within Python

### Project 8 - Movie Recommendation Project
[Link to project repo(Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/DominickTDS/Movie_Recommendation_Project)

The topic for this project is to simulate the segmentation and classification aspect of a recommendation system. I will use characteristic of movies to segment them and create a classification model based on the separation.Companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube have made the concept of recommendation systems a normalized and widely adaptive notion. Recommender systems are techniques that are designed to recommend certain things based on features or preferences. Below is a sample exert from analysis performed on modeling results. This is the avg duration by movie cluster.
